www file function (in order):
    Requires app.js which sets up the server
        const app = require("../app");
        
    Executes any startup scripts

    Setup default env variables (my own addition)

    Uses the imported app to creates the httpServer (or express server) after configured:
        var server = http.createServer(app); //(or could just use app.listen())

    Also sets the port:
        server.listen(port);

    Also sets the functions to be called if there is an error while starting the server:
        server.on('error', onError);
